  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Tech-savvy professional with over 5 years of experience across FinTech, Retail Banking, EdTech, and Digital Transformation, I have had the opportunity to work in roles that combine project management, product thinking, and customer success. I enjoy solving problems, bringing teams together and making sure that technology aligns well with business goals.
I currently manage multiple global accounts, handling everything from technical demos and onboarding to delivery coordination and ongoing support. I focus on making things easier for clients â€” whether it is through clear communication, timely delivery, or helping them get the most out of the product.
My day-to-day work involves collaborating with cross-functional teams, testing solutions, documenting requirements, and continuously improving the way we do things. I am comfortable working in fast-paced environments and take pride in being dependable and detail-oriented.
I believe in keeping things simple, being clear about expectations, and always staying curious about how to make products and experiences better.
